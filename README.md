# Cypress Designer
A web application for designing networked cyber-physical system experiments. Cyber-Physical networks (CPNS) are interconnected cyber and physical networks. The nodes at which cyber-physical networks are interconnected are called sensing and actuation units (SAX). The Cypress designer is a CAD environment for designing complex cyber-physical networks. It turns out that a few basic building block abstractions are all that is needed to build very complex and sophisticated cyber-physical networks. See the key features discussion below for the building blocks provided.

## We use the following open-source libraries
* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)
